//what is a searching algorithm
//implement linear search on arrays - data can be sorted or not
 /* function takes an arry and value and then loops the array compare the value to each element in the array.
 if found it return the index of the value. if not founf, it returns -1 
 Time complexity - O(N)*/ 

// implement binary search on sorted arrays - date must be sorted (implemented using the divide and conquer method)
/*gives O(logn) 
logn is used to get the number of steps taken as the size of the arry increases 
eg, if the size is 32 logn32 = 4, which means it takes four steps to find an element in an array of 32 items */
//implement a naive string searching algorithm
// implement the KMP string searching algorithm
