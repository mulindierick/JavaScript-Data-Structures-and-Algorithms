/* merger sort
spilt and merge
number of splits take O(logn)
the campare function takes O(n)
all total big O  gives O(logn) * O(n) = O(nlogn)


How it works 

create a merge function which takes in two arrays and merges them and returns a sorted arry. 
create an a fucntion which takes in an arry
recursively splits into into left and right until array lenth == 1
then returns merge function with left and right 

mergersort ([30, 23, 55, 65, 655, 565])
lef 30, 23, 55  right
lef 30, 23 
lf 30
